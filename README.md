# Data Case Study with Pandas - Famous Paintings
 
 ## Create your environment
```bash
python3.11.1 -m venv my_env1    # <-- choose yoor python version and name of your environment
```
1. Open your VS Code integrated terminal and run:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install sqlalchemy          # <-toolkit that simplifies the connection between Python and SQL databases
pip install psycopg2-binary     # <-database adapter for the Python
```

2. Download & unzip the dataset
- In VS Code terminal run:
```bash
kaggle datasets download \
  -d mexwell/famous-paintings\
  -p data/amous-paintings \
  --unzip
```

-d specifies the dataset slug; -p sets the target directory; --unzip extracts the files in place

- Load the data in Python:
In your .py or Jupyter file, use pandas to read whichever CSV(s) you need.

- For example (adjust the filename to match what was unzipped):
```bash
df = pd.read_csv('data/famous-paintings.csv')
print(df.head())
```
## Conecting python to Postgresql database
```python
conn_string = 'postgresql://user:password@localhost:0000/database'
engine = create_engine(conn_string)

db = create_engine(conn_string)
conn = db.connect()

try:
    conn = engine.connect()
    print(" Connection successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(" Connection failed:", e)

from sqlalchemy import text

result = conn.execute(text("SELECT version();"))

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

## Optional: Using .env for Security (Recommended):


```python
pip install python-dotenv
```


- Create a .env file:
```python
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
```
- Update Python code:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

load_dotenv()

conn_string = f"postgresql://{os.getenv('DB_USER')}:{os.getenv('DB_PASS')}@{os.getenv('DB_HOST')}:{os.getenv('DB_PORT')}/{os.getenv('DB_NAME')}"
engine = create_engine(conn_string)
conn = engine.connect()
```

## Creating a loop
```python
files = ['artist', 'canvas_size', 'image_link', 'museum_hours', 'museum', 'product_size', 'subject', 'work']

for file in files:
    df = pd.read_csv(f'/Users/user/Desktop/art/{file}.csv')
    df.to_sql(file, con=engine, schema='public', if_exists='replace', index=False)
    print(f" Uploaded: {file}")
```

## Case Study in the 'art' Database PostgreSQL

### Problem Statements:

1) List all the paintings which are not displayed on any museums?
2) Are there museums without any paintings?
3)  How many paintings have an asking price of more than their regular price?
4)  Identify the paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of their regular price?
5)  Which canva size costs the most?
6)  Which canvas is largest by physical size (width)?
7)  Identify the museums with invalid city information in the given dataset.
8)  Museum_Hours table has 1 invalid city information. Identify and remove it.
9)  Fetch the top 10 most famous painting subjects.
10) Identify the museums which are open on both Sunday and Monday. Display museum name & city.
11) How many museums open every single day.
12) Which is the top 5 most popular museums? (Popularity is defined based on the most no of paintings in a museum).
13) Who are the top 5 most popular artists? (Popularity is defined based on the most no of paintings done by an aartist).
14) Display the 3 least popular paintings.
15) Which museum is open for the longest during the day?
16) Which museum has the most No of most popular painting style?
